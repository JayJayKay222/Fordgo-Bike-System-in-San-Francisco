## Summary of Findings

> The Male Gender have more Bike Trips
- The mid day hours and Afternoon hours are the most numbers of trip but in my opinion this figure is better visualization than pervious one.
- Thursday is the day that most mubers of bike trips and Saturday and Sunday are the least ad they are the weekends.
- Most cycle journeys look to be a duration is between 5-10 minutes.
- Age 31 has th highest bike ride count
- The range from 24 to 36 are the most bikers and range 49 to 64 are the least
- And 18 year old are the least because it seems the data for this age is lower than other ages.
- Most bike trips are by male gender.
- Most number of bike trips are by subscriber users than customer users and i think it because the subscribers have offers for bike trips.
- Most trips distance are from 1-2km and the range of all trips from 0 to 5 km and rare who above 5 km.
- It should be noted that the trips with distance 0 km mean that the start and end station are the same but they made a trip
- There are relation between start_hour, end_hour and duration_min, distance_km.
- The median for afternoon and night periods is closer. the spread of data for morning period is between 10 to 11.Â¶
- The median trips distance for females is slightly higher than males despite of the number of males are higher.
- The median distance for all week days are almost the same.
- Using a clustered bar chart to display the categories from user type compared to age brackets to determine count of bike trips
- Afternoon and Morning periods have the highest for number of trips for all top start stations.
- The males have the highest for number of trips for all top start stations.
